# QuantumVizSim - Quantum Computing Simulator with Visualization

Welcome to QuantumVizSim! This project provides an interactive simulator for exploring quantum computing concepts using an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI). Whether you're new to quantum computing or already familiar with the basics, this simulator will help you visualize the behavior of qubits and quantum gates.

## Features

- Simulate quantum gates: Apply fundamental quantum gates like the Hadamard gate to qubits.
- Interactive visualization: See the effects of quantum gates on qubit states and measured probabilities.
- Easy setup: Run the simulator right from your computer's desktop using the GUI.
- Ideal for beginners: Designed to make quantum concepts accessible to everyone.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your computer.

2. **Clone the repository**: Open your terminal/command prompt and enter the following:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/akiraid-64/QuantumVizSim.git
   
3. Navigate to the directory:
 ```sh
cd QuantumVizSim
```

4.Install dependencies: Install the required Python packages using pip:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the simulator: Start the simulator by running the gui.py script:
 ```sh
python gui.py
```

Experiment: Use the GUI to input superposition percentages and explore how quantum gates affect qubit states and measured probabilities.
